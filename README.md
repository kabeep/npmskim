## 📖 Introduction

> WIP

In many cases, when we want to quickly understand a package, all we need is a glance at its `README.md`.

By checking the `Dependencies` section, we can roughly tell how the package works.

But in **monolithic applications**, this process often turns into a repetitive routine:

- Search for the package
- Open its README.md page
- Skim through the documentation
- Move on to the next dependency

Doing this over and over doesn’t help us think better — it only interrupts our focus.

This package solves exactly that problem. Everything is available in one place,

It even comes with a handy CLI utility — right in your terminal.
